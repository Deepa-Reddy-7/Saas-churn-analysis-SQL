**Key Findings**



* Churned customers were identified using explicit churn events rather than assumptions.
* Churn was unevenly distributed across plan tiers and countries.
* Product usage alone did not explain churn; churned users often showed similar or higher usage than retained users.
* Support tickets showed a stronger relationship with churn than usage metrics.
* Churned accounts raised more support tickets overall, indicating higher support friction.
* A churn risk model combining low usage and high ticket volume successfully segmented customers into High, Medium, and Low risk groups.
* Findings suggest that improving customer support experience may reduce churn more effectively than focusing only on engagement metrics.
